\chapter*{Abstract}
In this document a possible application of semantic web technologies to the development of present day web applications
through the development of RESTful semantic web services is discussed. A theoretical model for describing web
architectures as sets of semantic RESTful web services using process calculi theory and triple space computing is
described. This theoretical model is then transformed into a formal specfication, where different standard semantic
technologies are used to specify a mechanism for exposing and consuming semantic RESTful web services. An implementation
of this specification as a couple of server side and client side software libraries is also described. Finally, a
sample application consisting in a semantic mashup web application consuming different RESTful semantic web services
with the developed libraries is presented.
