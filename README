Semantic RESTful web services using hRESTS and MicroWSMO standard proposal: see http://cms-wg.sti2.org/TR/d12/v0.1/

This is a work in progress.

Currently there are rough implementations of the following components:
 
  - YAML based service description generation tool
  - Sample Rails application hRESTS/MicroWSMO enabled (extraction of the library to a gem is necessary)
  - JavaScript client and model layer implementation library.
